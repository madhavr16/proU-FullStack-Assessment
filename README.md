### Assumptions & Bonus Features Implemented

## Assumptions

 - The system is designed for use by Admin and Manager roles only.

 - Employee accounts are not intended to log in; instead, employees are managed by Admin/Manager through the dashboard.

 - The backend API expects valid JWT tokens for all protected routes, and the frontend assumes the token is stored in localStorage via Zustand persist.

 - Basic CRUD operations for Employees and Tasks assume a clean, pre-configured MongoDB instance.

 - All API endpoints follow a RESTful structure under /api/*.

## Bonus Features Implemented

 - Automatic Login After Registration
   When a user registers, the system immediately logs them in and redirects them to the dashboard.

 - Role-Based Authorization (Admin & Manager)
   Certain UI actions and API capabilities are available only based on the user’s role.

 - Fully Responsive Frontend UI
   The dashboard and forms are optimized for desktop and mobile screens.

 - Protected Routes on Frontend
   Users cannot access the dashboard without a valid JWT token.

 - Global State Management with Zustand (Persist Enabled)
   Auth state remains intact across page reloads and sessions.

 - Token Injection Using Axios Interceptors
   Every request automatically includes the auth token for smoother UX.

 - Search, Filters, and Pagination for Employees & Tasks
   Admin/Manager can easily navigate large data sets.

 - Task Status Visualization on Dashboard (Analytics Summary API)
   Includes overview stats such as total tasks, completed tasks, pending tasks, etc.
